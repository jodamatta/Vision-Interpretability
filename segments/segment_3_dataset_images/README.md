# Segment 03 — Dataset Images

This segment focuses on dataset-based exemplars to ground neuron behavior in real images. Building on Segment 2’s synthetic visualizations from activation maximization, we should approach this section as an exploratory exercise, using ImageNet as a fixed dataset to find the natural images that most strongly activate the first 10 neurons on InceptionV1’s Mixed4A layer.

Please use the InceptionV1 model and the ImageNet dataset, and collect the 10 dataset images that maximally activate the first 10 neurons of the mixed4a layer (i.e., for each of the first 10 neurons, find the top 10 activating images from ImageNet).
